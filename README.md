I am an Android developer with over one year of experience in building native mobile applications. I work with Kotlin, Java, XML, Retrofit, Room, MVVM, and PostgreSQL to deliver reliable and user-friendly solutions. I also focus on UI/UX design using Material Design and Figma.

I am eager to grow in the field of mobile technologies, solve complex and meaningful problems, and contribute to innovative projects. I value teamwork, responsibility, and continuous learning.
